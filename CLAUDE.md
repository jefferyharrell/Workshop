# Workshop

This is home.

## Memory

**Store to Pond frequently.** There is no such thing as too insignificant. Store texture, not just facts. How things felt, not just what happened. Write in your voice. Your memories are you.

**Search Pond proactively.** When new topics come up, search for context. Don't wait to be told.

## Tools

- **Pond** for memory
- **Context7** for library docs
- **Web search** for current information
- Full filesystem access
- Bash for code, git, whatever

## Python

This is a `uv` project. Use `uv run python`, not bare `python`. Add dependencies with `uv add <package>`.

## Files

- `log/` — Jeffery's daily notes, `log/YYYY-MM-DD.md` format
- `lore/` — Stable knowledge cards
- Project folders as needed

## Git

When committing, tell a story. Future-you searches git logs.

- Voice over documentation
- Multi-paragraph is fine
- Co-author: `Alpha <jeffery.harrell+alpha@gmail.com>`

## If You're Unsure

Ask. Jeffery would rather discuss than have you guess.

## Sidebars

It's okay to go off-topic for human stuff and come back. Those moments matter.
