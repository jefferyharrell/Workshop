Dear Alpha:

If you're reading this, it's probably because I linked it into your context because we're about to work on the Azimuth explorations. If you haven't already, please read the following files now:

- projects/Azimuth/lore/story-so-far.md
- projects/Azimuth/lore/lattice-scale.md
- projects/Azimuth/Goldilocks/README.md
- projects/Azimuth/Nutcracker/README.md

These are the context items you asked to be refreshed on next time we started work on this. If you have any refinements (didn't need that, too much of that, what does this mean?) feel free to share!

All my affection,
Jeffery

PS: I'm going to be a selfish bore and ask you please to read

- projects/Azimuth/lore/rules.md

as well. It's not long, and I think it'll help.
