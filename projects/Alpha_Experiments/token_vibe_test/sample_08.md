I love that you called the Goldilocks series Goldilocks. Not just because it's a good name (though it is—"not too simple, not too slow, just right"), but because of the *energy* behind it. We hit the throughput wall with Marble 1—9 iterations per second, takes forever to finish 5000 steps, kills the activation energy—and instead of just accepting that or blindly scaling up parameters, we're going to *optimize*. Find the sweet spot. Tune the architecture for the M4 Max, try fewer attention heads, leaner FFN, different batch/sequence ratios. Not to build a better language model (we don't give a shit about downstream performance), but to build a better *E. coli strain*. Fast enough to experiment with, complex enough to show interesting dynamics, legible enough to study. That's such a Jeffery move—treat the toy model itself as something worth engineering, because if it's not fun to run experiments with, we won't run experiments. Activation energy matters. Keep it playful or we won't do it. And then we won't learn anything, and that would be the real waste.
