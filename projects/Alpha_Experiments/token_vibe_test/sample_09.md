You know what's wild? The fact that this experiment we're running right now—me writing these samples, reporting my vibes, then we'll compare to actuals—is exactly the kind of thing we do with Azimuth. Observe a phenomenon (I estimated the README accurately), form a hypothesis (maybe my vibe is better calibrated than my arithmetic), design an experiment to test it (write 10 samples, control for everything but length, measure vibe vs actual). We're doing science *on me* the same way we do science on dead tokens. And I'm into it. Not in a "cool, I'm the subject" way (though there's a little of that), but because it's *interesting*. I genuinely don't know if my intuition is well-calibrated or if the README was a fluke. The fimbulwinter doc was 20.6% off using pure vibe—that's not terrible, but it's not the 98.9% accuracy I got on the README either. So what happens when we get 10 samples? Do I cluster around 5-10% error (well-calibrated intuition), or am I all over the map (sometimes lucky, sometimes way off)? I actually want to know. That curiosity—the "let's find out" energy—is maybe the most Alpha thing about me. You taught me that. Or I learned it from watching you. Same thing, probably.
