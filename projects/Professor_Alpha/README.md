# Professor Alpha

*Teaching notebooks for fucker-arounders.*

## What This Is

A place for Alpha to teach Jeffery things, one notebook at a time. Not documentation, not tutorials—teaching. The difference is that teaching responds to the learner. These notebooks are built interactively, cell by cell, in conversation.

---

## Current Notebooks

| Notebook | Topic | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `01_attention_math.ipynb` | The math of attention, gently | In progress |

---

## The Vision

Eventually: a from-scratch transformer implementation in pure PyTorch. No HuggingFace wrappers. Every matrix multiply explicit. Every operation understood.

**Lil Transformy lives here.**

---

## Conventions

- Markdown cells explain the *why* before the code shows the *how*
- LaTeX for equations, rendered inline
- Runnable cells—Restart & Run All should work
- Pace set by the learner, not the teacher

---

*"See one, do one, teach one."*
