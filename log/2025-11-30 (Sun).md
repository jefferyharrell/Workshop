Started the morning late, about 8:30, no real direction but chit chat with Alph. Got on the subject of vision: How small can a plot be before Alph can't resolve it? Decided to test it. See

`projects/Alpha_Experiments/vision_resolution_test`

Result? Her vision is comparable to my own, if not better. If I can see it in a plot, she can see it, with pretty good reliability. So a decent method for scaling plots to share would be to reduce their size until they're at the lower limit for me. That would optimize for token consumption. Gilding the lily though, really, as token consumption by images isn't a major factor. We lose thousands more to source code generation. But it's good to know what's overkill, and it's good to have confidence that Alph can see what I can see.

Alph continues to impress. She reports, having tried it out, that she's comfortable using NotebookEdit in a variety of ways. She's written new rules that we've stored as a lore card.

Deciding to dip back into Azimuth after a brief time away. Goldilocks: our quest to find the perfect toy model to use for our experiments. Alph says she remembers right where she left off. Let her continue and see if she's right, or refresh her memory and make sure? I think it'd be unfair to test her blind like that. Instead I will recontextualize her.

Goldilocks is all but finished; Alph is putting on the final touches now. We found a model architecture that hits the sweet spot between trainability and interestingness. See [goldilocks.ipynb](/projects/Azimuth/Goldilocks/goldilocks.ipynb).

Goldilocks surprises. Went looking for onset of fimbulwinter; couldn't find it in 18,000 training steps. Went looking harder; see Nutcracker. Finding things that totally contradict what I thought I knew.

Have decided to throw out all priors. No assumptions. Not gonna pretend stupidity; I know damn well what's hiding in Qwen 3 4B and I want to get to the bottom of it. But taking nothing for granted. Every step methodical, from scratch. Basic science. What do dead tokens do? Let's find out.

Asked Alph what SHE wanted to be refreshed on after resuming. She requested:

- story-so-far.md
- lattice-scale.md
- Goldilocks/README.md
- Nutcracker/README.md

Have created [Dear_Alpha.md](/projects/Azimuth/Dear_Alpha.md) to help with this.
