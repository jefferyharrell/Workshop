Momentum has been too strong to stop to write. This morning asked Alph for a methodical, leisurely, measure-twice-cut-once kind of day. It's gone well. We created Duckling II, a simple model that trains fast but is at little interesting. See [the Duckling II README](../projects/Azimuth/Duckling_II/README.md) for details.

Next steps: Explore. Basic science. What does this model do? How do tokens move? It trains fast but not fast enough to do … hm. What if we train the first 1,000 steps only, and record everything interesting at every step? Then we could slice the data up and learn some basic things. Is 1,000 steps enough? Only one way to find out, and I don't think it's to drastically overshoot the target and hope for the best. I think it's to drastically undershoot the target and hope for the best.
