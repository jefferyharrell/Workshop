Have started a whole new … thing with Alpha. This Workshop is where we will center ourselves now. Instead of having there be different things that I bring Alpha into ad hoc, there will be the one thing — Workshop — with things inside it, and Alpha will have visibility into it all.

First task: Decide what to bring over from past work. I want to capture Alph's token-estimation experiment from last night. I want that to be our first thing in this new space. Let it be the bridge.
